This is a very basic "particle-in-fluid" simulation for ENLR 5131.
This simulation will calculate the velocity and position of the particle using Euler's method, a first-order approximation using derivatives and small time-steps

Tests available:<br>
  CheckBoundary: Plot an image of the boundary conditions using matplotlib
    - To run: python3 main.py test_boundary
